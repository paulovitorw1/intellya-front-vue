### Project Architecture
The project follows the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architectural pattern. This pattern helps separate the concerns of the application and provides a clear separation between the data, presentation logic, and user interface.

In addition, the project utilizes the Adapter design pattern. Adapters are used to convert the data obtained from external sources, such as APIs, into a format that can be used by the application.
